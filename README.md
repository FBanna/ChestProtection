**CHEST PROTECTION**

Easy to use, vanilla friendly, fully server side trading and locking fabric mod for modern versions of Minecraft

**Locking**
Sign a book “LOCK”, put it in the first slot of a chest. It is now locked! Only you can open it. This protects against:
- explosions, eg. TNT, end crystals
- Wither break mechanics
- Placing chests next to it to move the book out of the first slot
- Breaking
- hoppers

**Selling**
Sign the book “SELL”, put it in the first slot of the chest. The same protections exist as locking. When you open the chest it will prompt you to put some items in the left and right hand middle slot. You can no longer buy or sell stacks greater than the max stack size. When you put items in some green wool will appear. These let you choose what data you want to keep with the item. For example buying swords, but you don’t care about its damage or enchantments or name. So click those prices of wool so they turn red then close the chest. Another example is selling shulker. But you don’t care what colour box it is so click the green wool called Item so it turns red then close the chest. Most of the time you will not have to mess with the wool at all

Enjoy, any problems create a issue request on the GitHub page.

I’ll slowly update this project to newer versions when I have the time
